Back when my friends and I used to go to the lab to work on our lab reports, we always had trouble remembering our Gmail passwords. Every time, we had to click 'forgot password,' and sometimes the verification code would go to my parents’ phones 📱, which meant we had to use someone else's gmail that was already in the lab PC just to access our emails and send our files(bad bad, very bad manners....).

I really wished there was a simple website where we could just share files without logging in or signing up. Something where we could create a code (or room), send files, and later access them at home using that code. My idea was inspired by tools like CodeShare and AnyDesk 💻.

It would be great if both the sender and receiver could use any device and still share files easily, plus chat at the same time. Not just chatting, but file sharing too.

I really want to learn this and create it myself 🚀 because I’m a developer and I enjoy solving problems.
